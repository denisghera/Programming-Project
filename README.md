# Programming-Project
Year 1 / Semester 2 Project in C

This project is a simple inventory app that manages a list of products for a company.
From the main menu you can display the full list or just the low-quantity products, add or remove products, update an existing one, search for them by category/name.

The data.csv file is used to retrieve and save the list of products used in the app.

*This app uses linked lists.
